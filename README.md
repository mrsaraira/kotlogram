Kotlin, what is that, I don't know this language!
----------------
Don't worry, Kotlin is a JVM language just like Java and Scala, and is fully interoperable with Java! You can use this as a standard Java Library.
Kotlogram uses Kotlin to improve the usability of the lib. The TL Language used by Telegram's protocol as used requires a lot of boilerplate code when modeled in a language like Java. To be more developer-friendly, the lib includes a lot of utils in the form of Kotlin extension functions and properties.

TODO list
----------------
- WIP Client handler + other refactors
